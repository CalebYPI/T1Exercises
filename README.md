# Programs on 1-d and 2-d Arrays:

- 1.	Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum value of a 1-d array.
- 2.	Write a Java program without using a second array to reverse elements of each row of a 2-d array of integer values. 
- 3.	Write a java program to print the Pascalâ€™s Triangle using a 2-d array
- 4.	Write a Java program to convert an array to ArrayList and an ArrayList to an array
- 5.	Write a Java program to arrange the elements of a given array of integers where all negative integers appear before all the positive integers.
- 6.	Given two sorted arrays A and B of size p and q, write a Java program to merge elements of A with B by maintaining the sorted order i.e. fill A with first p smallest elements and fill B with remaining elements.
- 7.	Write a Java program to rearrange a given array of unique elements such that every second element of the array is greater than its left and right elements.
- 8.	Write a Java program to form the largest number from a given list of non-negative integers.
- 9.	Write a Java program to shuffle a given array of integers.
- 10.	Write a Java program to find maximum product of two integers in a given array of integers.   

# Programs on Linked-List:
- 1.	Write a program using single Linked list to multiply the two-following polynomial:
        A: 7x2 + 5x +3
        B: 3x + 7
- 2.	Write a program using linked list to represent a 7-digit non-negative integer.
- 3.	Write a program in Java to find out if there exits a loop in a single linked-list
- 4.	Given a singly linked linear list, write a function to convert it to a circular list.
- 5.	Given two circular lists A and B, write an O(1) function to join them into one circular list A, leaving the other list B empty.
- 6.	Remove duplicate values from a given doubly linked list
- 7.	Swap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked List
